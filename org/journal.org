  - [ ] Parallelization
    - [ ] Find literature about Markov fields computation
      parallelization
    - [ ] Take a look at Stable set \to Markov fields decomposition

*** Tumor detection process                                        :software:
    1. ROI localization
      a. Build the reference model of healthy subjects:
        - Find data cluster according to their distribution (multiple
        scale t-distributions) using the EM algorithm 
        - Aggregate these distributions into a mixture model
      b. Distriminate abnormal voxels:
        - By using reference model to compute likelyhood score for each
          voxels 
        - Determine a threshold to distinguish healthy from pathological
	  - Compute the different anomaly level thresholds using slope
            heuristic
	  - Compute threshold of only 2 components (healthy /
            pathological) and keep the closest to one of the threshold
            computed previously.
    2. Build a anomaly model:
       - same as in 1.a on abnormal voxels
    3. Fingerprint model \to Supervised learning to characterize the
       different tumor types:
       - Compute the proportion of each anomaly clusters in the tumors
       - Take into account their sizes.
    4. Remove healthy isolated voxels considered as abnormal.
       - Refined segmentation \to erosion-dilatation kernel to remove
         isolated voxels.
       - Refined fingerprint model \to redo 3. using refined segmentation
